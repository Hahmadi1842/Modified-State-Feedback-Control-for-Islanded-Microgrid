# Modified-State-Feedback-Control-for-Islanded-Microgrid
In this study, a genetic algorithm is used to develop a self-regulatory process without trial and error to tune th state islanded microgrid's secondary controllers.
more detail dat about formulation and tuning process are provided in attached .pdf file.
